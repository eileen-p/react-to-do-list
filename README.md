### Getting Started

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
2. Clone this repo and cd into it
3. Run `yarn install` to install required dependencies
4. Run `yarn start` to run your site in development mode

For production builds, run `yarn build` to generate an HTML and JS file for your app. This can be served elsewhere.
